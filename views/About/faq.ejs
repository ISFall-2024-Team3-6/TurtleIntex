  <h1>FAQs</h1>

  <h5>How and Where are the Vests Distributed?</h5>
    <p>
      During the winter of 2017-18, the distribution and 
      testing were done mainly in the Ogden area with the help 
      and support of The Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd 
      and the staff at Youth Futures.<br>
      Winter 2018-19 we have been able to distribute vests both 
      to shelters and to individuals in the Ogden and Salt Lake City 
      communities.<br>
      For a detailed list of donations, click <span 
      href="views/donation.ejs">here.</span></p>

    <h5>I want to Help, but I Don't Sew</h5>
    <p>
      Turtle Shelter Project vests are designed to 
      be made by volunteers who have no special sewing 
      skills. We can put any willing volunteer to work who 
      can use a marker or a pair of scissors. Although we do 
      need people with basic and advanced sewing skills, there 
      are lots of the steps that can be done by those with 
      no sewing skills. The final construction is done by our 
      expert staff.   The completed vests are then returned to 
      the community where volunteers made them - or to another 
      area with need.</p>

    <h5>I Don't Live Near Northern Utah. Can I Still Help?</h5>
    <p>
      Yes!<br>
      We can send parts of the vests to be cut, marked, and/or 
      completed by your group and sent back to us, or we can provide 
      materials and training so you can complete entire vests and 
      distribute them in your area.<br>
      We live by the motto that every person can serve, and we 
      will accommodate anyone who wants to help - we are only 
      limited by our funding. Send us a note in <span href="contact.ejs">
      Contact Us</span>or <span href="/views/eventSignup.ejs">Schedule 
      Your Own Event</span> and we will coordinate the best project for 
      you and/or your group.</p>

    <h5>How Will My Donation Be Used?</h5>
    <p>
      Our overhead costs are very limited because our staff 
      is 100% volunteer. We have no paid employees. Our yearly 
      operating costs include business registration, website hosting 
      and support, post office box rental, and liability insurance. 
      Other expenses have been to purchase things like scissors and 
      sewing machines. During 2018 these costs were about 25% of our 
      total budget.<br>
      Also, if you would like to make a donation specifically for 
      materials or a certain part of our project, we will honor your 
      request.</p>

    <h5>Why Not Just Do a Coat Drive?</h5>
    <p>
      The foam insulation layer combined with moisture wicking 
      fabrics creates a more effective insulation layer than other 
      winter clothing. Clothing made from foam will provide warmth 
      even if it is wet - it allows the wearer to maintain their 
      core body temperature. You can read more about it in 
      <span href="ourTech.ejs">Our Tech.</span>

    <h5>What Does the Turtle in Your Logo Have to Do With Your Project?</h5>
    <p>
      A turtle carries it's shelter wherever it goes. Our insulated 
      vests are intended to be a portable “shelter.” Instead of having 
      to find shelter, a person can carry their shelter on their back, 
      like a turtle.

    <h5>How Long Has the Turtle Shelter Project Been in Service?</h5>
    <p>
      Our founder Jen had the idea for the Turtle Shelter Project in 2015 to 
      help keep people experiencing homelessness from freezing to death. We 
      officially incorporated on April 3, 2017, on the anniversary of Jen's 
      sobriety. Our 501c3 status was granted in 2018.<br>
      Between September 2017 and January 2018, with a combined 450 
      volunteer hours, we completed 50 prototype vests to be tested.
