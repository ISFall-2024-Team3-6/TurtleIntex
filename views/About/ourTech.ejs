<!-- All of the content below was taken right from the original Turtle Shelter Project website. Until we better understand
 the technology, we thought it best to keep the original statements -->
    <h5>Our Vests</h5>
    <p>Foam clothing technology was invented by outdoor survival expert Jim Phillips. 
      He has done extensive testing using open-cell polyurethane foam as the insulation 
      layer in jackets, hoods, pants, boots, gloves, and sleeping bags.<br>

      Jim Phillips' foam clothing is brilliant technology because of what it can do to help 
      save a person's life in freezing temperatures. The insulation layer foam clothing provides 
      is so effective that even if a person gets wet it will keep them warm -- BUT, wearing synthetic 
      fabrics is an important layer to include with the foam clothing. Foam clothing can be effective
       while wearing cotton if the wearer stays dry, but if the wearer gets wet, the cotton will absorb 
       and hold water and keep the wearer cold.  If a person is not wearing any cotton with the foam 
       clothing, and they happen to get wet, they will still be able to maintain their core body temperature.  
       The reason why this works is because the shell and lining fabrics and the foam are all synthetic and 
       breathable - providing moisture wicking properties and allowing perspiration and other moisture to evaporate.</p>

       <h5>Foam clothing dramatically reduces moisture as being a threat to a person's life in the cold!</h5>
       <p>Foam clothing is marketed to emergency preparedness and extreme sports audiences because of its ability 
        to keep you warm in winter conditions.  Being cold is one thing, but being cold and wet is miserable. Being 
        cold, wet, and without shelter can be life threatening. <br>

        This technology is usually sold in emergency preparedness venues and super expensive. It does make sense 
        because the technology is super valuable that the clothing should cost a lot, but we disagree:  nobody 
        likes to be cold and people function a lot better when they are not freezing to death!  So we created a 
        foam vest that covers the core and we called the Turtle Shelter because it acts like a shelter and harnesses 
        the wearer's body heat even while wet and even in freezing temperatures. </p>

        <h5>Jen's perspective:  Every life has value!</h5>
        <p>"Hearing about this technology in an emergency Preparedness venue provoked a lot of 
          thought about how many homeless peoples lives could not only be saved but also improved 
          by this technology? Emergency preparedness is all about people getting prepared for when 
          disaster strikes...and it seems like to get prepared can be pretty pricey...but isn't a 
          person who is homeless living in their emergency right this very moment? They are not waiting 
          for disaster to strike because for them it already has and I know from experience that once 
          the disaster of homelessness strikes it can be extremely hard to recover from it. For many 
          it is far more than simply losing a home or a place to stay...for me and many others it was 
          also about losing my confidence, my energy, my drive, and even my hope...I felt completely 
          broken and defeated!<br>

          I remember how every simple task felt like an overwhelming obstacle but even more so when it 
          was so cold I couldn't even think. Everything just felt harder when it was cold and wet and miserable...
          I believe that this foam clothing can help relieve some of the suffering for anyone who is homeless and 
          living in the cold...I believe it doesn't have to cost a lot to make these. Not for the homeless 
          and not for our families...lives can be saved from this technology."</p>
